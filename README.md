# Toronto-Housing-Market-Analysis

## Project Objective

The purpose of this project is to understand the history, current state, and potential future of the overall Toronto housing market using publicly available CENSUS data sources 

## Gather Our Data

To first understand the market we need to understand what kind of questions we want answered. We know that we want to understand the housing market in Toronto, but how exactly can we do that? One approach is by asking a variety of questions that will help us split up the population of Toronto in such a way that we can accurately diversify the data.

For this project we will attempt to answer the following questions:

1. What is the past population of Toronto compared to the rest of the GTA?
2. What are the age groups by gender in Toronto?
3. Which geenration of immigrants is the most prevelant?
4. Where are citzens of Torotno immigrating from?
5. How much does a household make annually per ward/district?
6. How much are house prices per ward/dsitrcit?
7. How is the Toronto housing index performing?
